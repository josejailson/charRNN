# A shakespearean text generator 
CharRNN is a famous application of recursive networks for Natural Language Processing (NLP), where the model learns grammar, ponctuation and more. 
All this just learning to predict the next characters in a text! 
This project is a from scratch implementation.
You can play with this model on https://huggingface.co/spaces/josejailson/shakespeare.
